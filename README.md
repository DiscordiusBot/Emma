How did I get this idea?

I was bored of Discordius, so I went to watch a youtube video. It was about anime, and how they program it. Then I though of Discord randomly, I was asking myself; "what do people like to use most?", and I keep thinking until I realized it was anime they love. So I though, why not make a bot based off anime? And poof. But Emma is not exactly in anime, xd.
